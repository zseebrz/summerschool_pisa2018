# summerschool_pisa2018
Python cripts and Tableau visualisations related to my presentation "Identifying and visualising tonality/emotion and geographical information in the text of ECA Special Reports using IBM Watson and Tableau" at the 2018 Summer School in public auditing and accountability, Pisa   
The aim of this GitHub repo is to provide a "starting kit" to the participants interested in text mining enabling them to make the firts steps in analyzing their own documents. They Python scripts will follow in the coming days.
